### Change Logging Rule
**ALWAYS update the Update Log section of scope.md when making significant changes to the project.** This includes:
- Completing milestone tasks (check off items in M0-M9)
- Completing phase tasks (check off items in Phase 0-10)
- Making architectural decisions or changes
- Adding new dependencies or tools
- Resolving open questions
- Making environment or configuration changes

**Update Log Format:**
```
- v0.X: Brief description of what was accomplished
- v0.X+1: Next significant change
```

**Examples of what requires logging:**
- ✅ Completed milestone: "M0 — Repository & Base App: [x] New Next.js app scaffolded"
- ✅ Added new dependency: "Added shadcn/ui components"
- ✅ Configuration change: "Configured local Supabase development environment"
- ✅ Architecture decision: "Decided to use TanStack Query for server state management"

**Examples of what doesn't require logging:**
- ❌ Minor code refactoring
- ❌ Bug fixes (unless they represent significant architectural changes)
- ❌ Documentation updates to existing sections

This rule ensures the scope.md remains a living document that accurately reflects the current state and progress of the project.
